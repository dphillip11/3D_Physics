# 3DRendering

I have a plan to firstly make a simple 3D physics simulation, spheres and planes initially, using C++ and render it using modern OpenGL. I think I will try to create a 3D pong style game where the bat moves along 2 axes but I'm not sure how playable it will be, maybe a trail effect/ conveniently placed light sources will help. I will then get to work on cubes and add some angular momentum at which point I guess multithreading is going to be more important. I'm going to try to form an ECS architecture to deal with the collisions, physics and rendering in a performant and easily threaded way.

What could go wrong?
